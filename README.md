**House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Overview**

This House Price Prediction project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features, such as the size of the house, the number of rooms, and the location. The goal is to provide a predictive model that can help real estate professionals and homebuyers make informed decisions based on historical data.

The project involves a series of steps, including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation. It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to a real-world problem and how to choose the right algorithms to make predictions based on available data.

**Features**

	•	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Handling Missing Data: Identifying and filling in or dropping rows with missing values.
	•	Feature Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.
	•	Feature Scaling: Standardizing or normalizing features to bring them to a common scale, which is important for certain models.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Visualizing the data to understand trends, distributions, and relationships between different features (e.g., using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps).
	•	Identifying important features that most significantly impact the house prices.
	•	Model Building:
	•	Implementing several regression models such as:
	•	Linear Regression: A simple approach that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable (house price).
	•	Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values.
	•	Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.
	•	Gradient Boosting Regressor: An advanced ensemble technique that builds multiple weak models to create a stronger overall prediction.
	•	Model Evaluation:
	•	Comparing models based on evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R²) to assess the quality of predictions.
	•	Fine-tuning models to improve their performance.
	•	Model Deployment (Optional):
	•	If desired, the model can be deployed using Flask or any other deployment framework to make real-time predictions via a web interface.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to house sales. Each record represents a house with its corresponding features and sale price. Some of the key features in the dataset include:
	•	Location: The area or neighborhood of the house.
	•	Square Footage: The size of the house in square feet.
	•	Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms: The count of rooms and bathrooms.
	•	Year Built: The year the house was constructed.
	•	Lot Size: The area of the land on which the house is built.
	•	Other Features: Such as the garage size, proximity to schools, etc.

The dataset is used to train machine learning models that can predict the price of a house based on these features.

**Technology Stack**

This project is implemented in Python using popular libraries and tools in data science and machine learning:
	•	Programming Language: Python 3.x
	•	Libraries:
	•	Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis (e.g., loading the dataset, cleaning, and transforming data).
	•	NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations and plots to help in the EDA phase.
	•	Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms (regression models, preprocessing tools, and evaluation metrics).
	•	Jupyter Notebook: For interactive exploration of the dataset and model development.
	•	Tools for Deployment (Optional):
	•	Flask: If you wish to deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
	•	Heroku or AWS (Optional): For hosting the model in a cloud environment.

**Installation and Setup**

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Pip (Python’s package installer)
	•	Virtualenv (recommended)

Steps to Setup the Project

	**1.	Clone the repository**
Clone the project to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/Nikitha130731/house-price-prediction.git  
cd house-price-prediction  


	**2.	Set up a virtual environment**
It’s a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies:

python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  


	**3.	Install required dependencies**
Install the required Python libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt  


	**4.	Run the Jupyter Notebook**
If you want to interact with the notebook for data exploration and model training:

jupyter notebook  


	**5.	Deploy the model (optional)**
If you wish to deploy the model as a web application, run the Flask app:

python app.py  

**Usage**

	**1.	Explore the data:**
Use the Jupyter notebook to inspect the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and visualize relationships between features and the target variable (house price).
	**2.	Preprocess the data:**
Clean and transform the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
	**3.	Train the model:**
Implement various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to train on the dataset. Evaluate the models using metrics such as RMSE and R².
	**4.	Make Predictions:**
Use the trained models to predict house prices on new data or for validation.
	**5.	Deploy the model (optional):**
